# CaloriTrack - Calorie Tracking App

## Project Overview
This is a React Native & Expo-based calorie tracking application built with TypeScript. The app helps users track their daily calorie intake through camera-based food recognition, manual meal logging, and progress visualization.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** React Native with Expo Router (~6.0.14)
- **Language:** TypeScript (~5.9.2)
- **UI:** Custom components with design system
- **Navigation:** React Navigation with Expo Router
- **State Management:** React Context API
- **Storage:** AsyncStorage
- **Camera:** Expo Camera & Image Picker
- **Notifications:** Expo Notifications

## Core Features
- Camera-based food recognition
- Manual meal logging
- Daily calorie tracking
- Progress visualization with charts
- User profile and goal setting
- Onboarding flow
- Haptic feedback

## Design System
- **Primary Colors:** Purple-based palette (#7C3AED, #EC4899)
- **Typography:** Inter font family with consistent spacing
- **Components:** Modern card-based layouts with shadows
- **Theme:** Light and dark mode support

## Code Style
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ES6+ syntax with React hooks
- Functional components with props interface
- Consistent naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for variables)
- Absolute imports using @ alias

## Key Dependencies
- expo-camera (~17.0.9) for camera functionality
- expo-image-picker (~17.0.8) for image selection
- @react-navigation/* for navigation
- react-native-reanimated (~4.1.1) for animations
- expo-notifications (~0.32.13) for push notifications

## Development Rules
1. Always use TypeScript with strict mode
2. Follow the established design system and color palette
3. Use functional components with React hooks
4. Implement proper error handling and loading states
5. Ensure accessibility with proper ARIA labels and touch targets
6. Write reusable components in the components directory
7. Use React Context for global state management
8. Follow React Native and Expo best practices
9. Test on both iOS and Android platforms
10. Optimize images and performance for mobile devices

## Special Considerations
- Camera permissions handling
- Image processing and optimization
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Offline data synchronization
- User privacy and data protection
